in english:
I want to create a table from two existing tables, original and update.
I want to choose all values from update, unless it doesn't exist, and then I'll keep original.
There are 3 new rows in update, so I want to insert those. Total rows should be 791 + 3 = 794

ONE ROW FOR EACH DAY AND EACH STATION

# of rides (and bikes) that started at the station

The total amount of time spent on rides
The avg amount of time spent on rides
The median amount of time spent on a ride
The most common station that people rode to from that station
The most common station that people rode from to that station
Any other useful stats you can think of (including from other datasets if youâ€™re feeling adventurous)
