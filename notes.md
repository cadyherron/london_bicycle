Why I chose Option 1: 
1. It seems closely related to the ongoing work that Kale described in our call
2. I'm not familiar with Google BigQuery and this seemed like a great opportunity to learn it
3. I enjoy writing SQL queries





1. I copied the public data twice: 1 copy to work with and 1 as a backup. If memory/space was an issue, I'd either skip this step or back it up to Google Storage.
2. I loaded the JSON data into staging tables: cycle_stations_update and cycle_hire_update
3. From there, I explored the data in the update tables. I found that 3 rows in cycle_stations weren't in the update, and I chose to keep them when I did the merge.
4. I created new tables that merged the updated and original tables: cycle_stations_merged and cycle_hire_merged

```sql
CREATE TABLE `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_stations_merged` AS (
  SELECT * FROM `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_stations_update`
  UNION ALL 
  (SELECT * FROM `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_stations` o WHERE o.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_stations_update`))
);

CREATE TABLE `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_hire_merged` AS (
  SELECT * FROM `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_hire_update`
  UNION ALL 
  (SELECT * FROM `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_hire` o WHERE o.rental_id NOT IN (SELECT rental_id FROM `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_hire_update`))
);
```

4. For the stats table, I started with one station to see if I could get all the data. I decided not to correctly handle rides that started on one day and ended on another day, in the interest of time.

```sql
select *
from (
  select stations.id as station_id, date(start.start_date) as day, count(start.rental_id) as rides_from_station
  from `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_stations_merged` stations
  join `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_hire_merged` start on start.start_station_id = stations.id
  where start.start_station_id = 395
  group by station_id, day
) start
join (
  select stations.id as station_id, date(endd.start_date) as day, count(endd.rental_id) as rides_to_station
  from `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_stations_merged` stations
  join `mailchimp-350820.london_bicycle.cycle_hire_merged` endd on endd.end_station_id = stations.id
  where endd.end_station_id = 395
  group by station_id, day
) endd on start.day = endd.day
order by start.day
```


cycle_stations has 791 rows
cycle_stations_update has 791 rows = 100% of rows

cycle_hire has 24,369,201 rows
cycle_hire_update has 1,217,716 rows = 5% of rows



GOTCHAS
- I needed to select EU for region, which wasn't the default
- cycle_hire.id is NULLABLE and not required, which isn't great for a primary key
- cycle_hire.locked is a string of "true" or "false" instead of a boolean

in english:
I want to create a table from two existing tables, original and update.
I want to choose all values from update, unless it doesn't exist, and then I'll keep original.
There are 3 new rows in update, so I want to insert those. Total rows should be 791 + 3 = 794

station_stats

ONE ROW FOR EACH DAY AND EACH STATION

# of rides (and bikes) that started at the station
# of rides (and bikes) that ended at the station
The total amount of time spent on rides
The avg amount of time spent on rides
The median amount of time spent on a ride
The most common station that people rode to from that station
The most common station that people rode from to that station
Any other useful stats you can think of (including from other datasets if youâ€™re feeling adventurous)
